    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      Pojox is a lightweight and intuitive tool that helps developers quickly
      convert JSON structures into classes for various programming languages. It
      was born out of the need to simplify model generation, especially during
      the early stages of building APIs and applications.

      Whether you're working with Java, TypeScript, Python, Kotlin or other
      languages, Pojox can help you save time and reduce repetitive work.
