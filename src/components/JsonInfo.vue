    <h1>Why use JSON format ?</h1>
    <p>
      Since we have other options like YAML, XML, etc.? Why <span>JSON</span> ?
      The answer lies in the history of client-server communication itself.
      Until a few decades ago, the communication between client and server was
      inefficient, as the server was overburdened with a heavy workload. For
      example, your web browser was only supposed to render things like outcomes
      of a web page search or any query result without any backend
      technicalities. The rest of the work from processing requests to
      forwarding them was weighed on the server. Thus, a lightweight and
      text-based structure like JSON format was needed to solve all these
      problems.
